- 🔭 I'm looking for my first job opportunity as a Front-end developer
- 🚀 I’m currently learning Jest (March, 2022)
- 🛸 Fun fact: I would like to go on a space trip. Since I was a child, I've been passionate about the universe with its galaxies, its suns, its planets... That's why Interstellar is my favorite movie.
